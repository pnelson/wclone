# wclone

`wclone` saves a copy of an HTML document and rewrites asset references to
point to local copies. It is less functional than 'Save As' from a modern
browser right now. I just thought it would be fun to write. It would be nice to
replace asset references within CSS and JS eventually.

## Usage

```
$ wclone http://pnelson.ca
```
